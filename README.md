# Scale & Reuse Self-hosted EC2 Runners for GitHub Actions

This action enables dynamic resource pooling and a native control plane for
self-hosted EC2 runners, offering:

- **Resource Pooling:** Workflows share a common resource pool - efficiently
  reusing provisioned compute resources.
- **Native Control Plane:** Operates with minimal infrastructure, requiring no
  external schedulers or controllers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modes of Operation

The action operates in three distinct modes:

1. **`provision`**: Allocates EC2 instances from the pool (or creates new ones
   if needed) workflow jobs. Use runners with: `runs-on: ${{ github.run_id }}`.
2. **`release`**: Returns the used EC2 instances to the pool for re-use.
3. **`refresh`**: Manages general configuration of the EC2 runner pool. This
   mode is intended to be run on a schedule (e.g., via cron) to:
   - Update the Launch Template with the latest AMI or configuration.
   - Refresh GitHub registration tokens.
   - Terminate instances that have exceeded maximum runtime or idle time.
   - Ensure a minimum number of idle runners are available

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **AWS Credentials:** Configure AWS credentials (e.g., via
  `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`) with permissions to manage EC2
  instances, Launch Templates, IAM roles, and potentially other related
  services.
- **GitHub Token (for `refresh` mode):** A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
  with `repo` scope is required for the `refresh` mode to register runners with
  GitHub. Store this as a secret.

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### 1. Provisioning and Releasing Runners in a Workflow

This example demonstrates provisioning runners that subsequent jobs can use by
targeting `github.run_id`.

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  provision_runners: # selects
    name: Provision
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Provision
        id: provision_step
        uses: <your-github-username>/ec2-runner-pool-manager@v1
        with:
          mode: provision
          instance-count: 2

  matrix_job_on_ec2:
    name: Run Matrix Job on EC2
    needs: provision_runners
    runs-on: ${{ github.run_id }} # use compute by referencing run id
    strategy:
      matrix:
        task_id: [1, 2]
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo "Running task ${{ matrix.task_id }}..."
          # Ensure your runner's pre-runner script or AMI has necessary tools
          sleep 20 # Simulate work for this task

  release_runners: # so other workflows can use compute
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - provision_runners
      - matrix_job
    if: ${{ always() }}
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Release
        uses: <your-github-username>/ec2-runner-pool-manager@v1
        with:
          mode: release
```

### 2. Scheduled Refresh for the Runner Pool

Create a separate workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/refresh-runners.yml`):

```yaml
name: Refresh EC2 Runner Pool

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *' # Example: Every 30 minutes
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  refresh_pool:
    name: Refresh Runner Pool
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_FOR_REFRESH }} # Use dedicated credentials if needed
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FOR_REFRESH }}
          aws-region: us-east-1 # Or your desired region
      - name: Refresh EC2 Runner Pool
        uses: <your-github-username>/ec2-runner-pool-manager@v1 # Replace with your action name
        with:
          mode: refresh
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT_FOR_RUNNERS }}
          ami: ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # Specify your latest AMI ID
          iam-instance-profile: YourInstanceProfileName
          security-group-ids: sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx sg-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
          subnet-ids: subnet-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa subnet-bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
          # Add other refresh-specific inputs as needed
          # e.g., idle-time-sec, max-runtime-min, resource-class-config
```
