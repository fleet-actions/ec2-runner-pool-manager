# Scale & Reuse Self-Hosted EC2 Runners for GitHub Actions

[![Coverage](./badges/coverage.svg)](./badges/coverage.svg)

This GitHub Action enables you to provision and reuse self-hosted EC2 runners
with a simple/native controlplane.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Motivation

This project was born from a desire to simplify the management of self-hosted
runners. The goal was to dynamically provision, pool, reuse, and safely control
runner lifetimes directly within GitHub Actions, avoiding the complexities of:

- Deploying and managing separate control planes.
- Configuring webhooks.
- Sifting through logs in external cloud providers, when GitHub Actions offers
  far more accessible runner logs.

Inspired by powerful tools like
[Actions Runner Controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller),
[terraform-aws-github-runner](https://github.com/github-aws-runners/terraform-aws-github-runner),
and [ec2-github-runner](https://github.com/machulav/ec2-github-runner), this
action explores streamlined, YAML-centric approach to runner pooling and
lifecycle management.

## ‚ú® Features

- Declaratively specify number of runners to provision for a workflow.
- Any provisioned runners are placed in a shared pool for other workflows to
  pick up.
- Minimize paying for cold-starts by reusing existing runners
- Native Control Plane in Github Actions for transparent runner logs:
  - See which instances are terminated, selected or created for a workflow.
- Declaratively specify lifetimes of runners
  - i.e., how long should a runner keep itself alive when put in the shared
    pool?

## üîç How does it work?

## üõ†Ô∏è Modes of Operation

The action operates in three distinct modes:

1. **`provision`**: Allocates EC2 instances from the pool (or creates new ones
   if needed) workflow jobs. Use runners with: `runs-on: ${{ github.run_id }}`.
2. **`release`**: Returns the used EC2 instances to the pool for re-use.
3. **`refresh`**: Manages general configuration of the EC2 runner pool. This
   mode is intended to be run on a schedule (e.g., via cron) to:
   - Update the Launch Template with the latest AMI or configuration.
   - Refresh GitHub registration tokens.
   - Terminate instances that have exceeded maximum runtime or idle time.
   - Ensure a minimum number of idle runners are available

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **AWS Credentials:** Configure AWS credentials (e.g., via
  `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`) with permissions to manage EC2
  instances, Launch Templates, IAM roles, SQS, DynamoDB.
- **GitHub Personal Access Token (for `refresh` mode):** A GitHub PAT with
  `repo` scope is required for the `refresh` mode to register runners with
  GitHub.
- **AWS Infrastructure:** Need available ec2 instance profile, subnet/s and
  security group/s.

## üöÄ QuickStart

### 1. Provision and Release Runners in a Workflow

This example demonstrates provisioning runners that subsequent jobs can use by
targeting `github.run_id`.

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  provision_runners:
    name: Pickup Or Create
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Provision
        id: provision_step
        uses: <your-github-username>/ec2-runner-pool-manager@v1
        with:
          mode: provision
          instance-count: 2

  matrix_job_on_ec2:
    name: Run Matrix Job on EC2
    needs: provision_runners
    runs-on: ${{ github.run_id }} # pickup compute via runId
    strategy:
      matrix:
        task_id: [1, 2]
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo "Running task ${{ matrix.task_id }}..."
          sleep 20 # Simulate work for this task

  release_runners:
    name: Release For Reuse
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [provision_runners, matrix_job]
    if: ${{ always() }}
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Release
        uses: <your-github-username>/ec2-runner-pool-manager@v1
        with:
          mode: release
```

### 2. Scheduled Refresh for the Runner Pool

Create a separate workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/refresh-runners.yml`):

```yaml
name: Refresh EC2 Runner Pool

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *' # OK as long as cron exeuctes 2-3x an hour
  workflow_dispatch: # Manually trigger whenever to get started

jobs:
  refresh_pool:
    name: Initialize Infra & Keep Tokens Fresh
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_FOR_REFRESH }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FOR_REFRESH }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Refresh EC2 Runner Pool
        uses: <your-github-username>/ec2-runner-pool-manager@v1
        with:
          mode: refresh
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT_FOR_RUNNERS }}
          ami: ami-123 # Specify your latest AMI ID
          iam-instance-profile: YourInstanceProfileName
          security-group-ids: sg-123
          subnet-ids: subnet-123 subnet-456
          # Add other refresh-specific inputs as needed
          # Seeüëá
```
