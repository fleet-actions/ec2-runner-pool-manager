# Fleet Validation

After the control-plane successfully requests new EC2 instances from AWS, a critical validation process must confirm that every new instance has successfully bootstrapped, registered with GitHub, and is healthy before it can be used.

This process is governed by a strict, **all-or-nothing** principle: if even a single instance in the newly created fleet fails its validation checks, the *entire fleet* is considered compromised and is terminated. This ensures that only fully operational and reliable sets of runners are introduced into the active pool.

## The Validation Handshake ü§ù

Validation relies on a handshake between the control-plane and the new instances, using DynamoDB as the coordination point. This avoids direct communication and creates a robust, event-driven process.

The sequence is as follows:

1. **Control-Plane Initiates & Assigns `runId`**: For each new EC2 instance, the control-plane creates a record in DynamoDB. This initial record has its state set to `created` and, most importantly, includes the `runId` of the workflow that requested it.

    ```json
    // Initial record created by control-plane in DynamoDB
    {
      "instanceId": "i-abcdef123456",
      "state": "created",
      "runId": "workflow-run-789", // Assigned by control-plane
      "threshold": "2025-06-01T10:05:00Z"
    }
    ```

2. **Instance Acts on `runId`**: The bootstrap script on the new instance (detailed in [Instance Initialization](../../instance-initialization.md)) polls its DynamoDB record. Once it detects the `runId`, it uses that ID to register itself as a GitHub Actions runner. This `runId` becomes the runner's label, ensuring it is targeted by the correct workflow jobs.

3. **Instance Signals Back**: Upon successful registration with GitHub, the instance writes a registration signal (e.g., `UD_REG_OK`) back to its DynamoDB record. In parallel, a `heartbeat.sh` agent sends periodic pings to DynamoDB to signal its liveness.

4. **Control-Plane Observes**: The control-plane's fleet validation routine polls DynamoDB, waiting for the expected registration and heartbeat signals from *every* instance in the fleet.

## Validation Logic & Outcomes

The control-plane's validation process waits for two conditions to be met for the entire fleet before a validation timeout expires.

* **Success**: If all instances pass both registration and heartbeat checks, the control-plane transitions their state in DynamoDB from `created` to `running`, and the fleet is ready for use.

    ```json
    // Record updated by control-plane after successful validation
    {
      "instanceId": "i-abcdef123456",
      "state": "running", // <-- Updated
      "runId": "workflow-run-789",
      "threshold": "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z" // New threshold for running state
    }
    ```

* **Failure**: If any instance fails a check or the validation timeout is reached, the control-plane terminates **every instance** in the fleet. The creation process is marked as failed, preventing a partially-healthy or unreliable fleet from being used.
