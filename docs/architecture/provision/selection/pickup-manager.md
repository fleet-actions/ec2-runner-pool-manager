# Pickup Manager

The Pickup Manager (PM) is an in-process component instantiated per workflow selection attempt. It is responsible for retrieving and filtering idle instance messages from the SQS-based [Resource Pool](../../resource-pool.md) to find suitable warm runners for the requestors ([Claim Workers](./claim-workers.md)) to fulfill the current workflow's requirements.

The Pickup Manager's core responsibilities are:

1. **Dequeueing Candidate Messages**: Retrieving messages from the relevant SQS resource pool queue.
2. **Filtering**: Evaluating the dequeued message (whose format is detailed in the [Resource Pool documentation](../../resource-pool.md)) against the requesting workflow‚Äôs specific compute requirements (e.g., instance type, usage class, CPU, memory).
3. **Dispatching or Re-queuing**:
    * ‚úÖ If a message represents a suitable instance, it's passed to a Claim Worker for an attempt to claim the instance.
    * ‚ôªÔ∏è If unsuitable for the current request, the message is returned to the SQS queue for other workflows.
    * ‚ùå If the message represents an invalid or malformed entry, it may be discarded.

## 1. Interfacing with SQS: The Pickup Lifecycle

The Pickup Manager interacts with SQS in a tight loop designed for low latency and efficient message handling. This process involves several conceptual SQS operations:

| Action by Pickup Manager | Conceptual SQS Operation | Purpose & Notes|
| :--| :-| :--|
| 1 Request a message from the resource class-specific SQS queue. | `ReceiveMessage`| A short poll used for discovering available idle runners. |
| 2 Delete the message from SQS. | `DeleteMessage` | As soon as received, delete the message from the queue to minimize contention by multiple concurrent Provision processes or workers |
| 3 Filter the message content in-memory.| N/A (Local operation) | The contents of message checked against the workflow‚Äôs provision inputs (e.g., `allowedInstanceTypes`, `usageClass`, etc.) |
| 4a :white_check_mark: **Pass-On (Match Found)**| N/A (Dispatch to Claim Worker) | If check is OK - PM hands to requesting [Claim Worker](./claim-workers.md) |
| 4b :recycle: **Re-queue (Filter Mismatch)** | `SendMessage`| If mismatching *current* workflow's compute constraints - message is requeued with a [short delay](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html) to minimize contention |
| 4c :x: **Discard (Invalid/Malformed Message)** | N/A (Already deleted) | Something is wrong with the message (ie. parsing, unexpected attributes), it is discarded |

## 2. Message Handling and Classification Logic

The Pickup Manager evaluates each dequeued message to determine its fate based on the workflow's requirements:

* **‚úÖ OK (Pass-On)**: The message's attributes (instance type, usage class, CPU/memory) are a suitable match.
    * **Action**: The message is passed to a [Claim Worker](./claim-workers.md) to attempt claiming the instance.

* **‚ôªÔ∏è Re-queue**: The instance is valid but doesn't meet the current workflow's specific filters (e.g., a different instance type is needed).
    * **Action**: The message is sent back to its SQS queue, making it available for other, potentially more suitable, workflow requests.

* **‚ùå Discard**: The message is malformed, describes an instance with specs that don't match its resource class, or is otherwise invalid.
    * **Action**: The message is logged and effectively dropped, as it was already deleted from the SQS queue upon receipt.

## 3. Pool Exhaustion Detection

The Pickup Manager can determine that a resource pool is "exhausted" for the current workflow's request through two main heuristics:

* **Globally Exhausted (Queue Empty)**:
    * If an attempt to receive a message from the SQS queue indicates that the queue for the target `resourceClass` is currently empty.
    * **Outcome**: The Pickup Manager signals to the Provision orchestrator that no idle instances are available in this pool at this moment.

!!! note "Sequence Diagram: Global Exhaustion"
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant ClaimWorker
        participant PM as "Pickup Manager"
        participant SQS_Pool as "SQS Resource Pool"

        ClaimWorker->>+PM: Attempt Pickup (workflow_requirements)
    
        PM->>+SQS_Pool: Request Message
        SQS_Pool-->>-PM: No message ü§∑
                    
        PM-->>-ClaimWorker: Return Null (Locally Exhausted for this workflow)
    ```

* **Locally Exhausted (Repetitive Unsuitable Messages)**:
    * To prevent an infinite loop due to the Pickup Manager requeueing behavior with unsuitable messages, it maintains an internal frequency count for each unique `instanceId` it encounters during its current operational cycle.
    * If the same `instanceId` is dequeued more than a defined tolerance threshold (ie., 5 times), the Pickup Manager considers the pool exhausted for the workflow.
    * **Outcome**: The message that triggered this tolerance is still re-queued (so it remains available for other, potentially different, workflow requests). However, the Pickup Manager signals `null` any interfacing claim workers - effectively suspending pickups for this workflow.
